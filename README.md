# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
Step 1: Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation.

Step 2: Import the sys module to use the built-in functions.

Step 3: Get input from the user for number of rows and add it by 1 for number of columns.

Step 4: Using np.zeros() set the matrix as null matrix.

Step 5: Using nested for loop get input from the user for each element in the matrix.

Step 6: Using nested for loop find the ratio and perform the elementary row operations and find the final matrix.

Step 7: Use back substitution method to find the value of the variables and print it.

Step 8: End the program.

## Program:

    print("X%d = %0.2f"  %(i,res[i]),end=" ")
#X0 = 53.35 X1 = -8.88 X2 =-4.40
